# Hi, There ðŸ‘‹

## Hello ðŸ‘‹, My name is **`Angel`**. I'm a **`Full Stack Developer`** from **`Ecuador`**.
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Astro, Laravel (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and MongoDb.

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to give me a shout out [@angelxehg](https://twitter.com/Danryzer007).

I love to learn about new technologies, what problems are they solving and How can I use them to build better and scalable products.
